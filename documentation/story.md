# Story

Max is a digital avatar trapped inside an unstable simulation known as "The Glitch". The world around him is fragmenting, creating dangerous gaps, moving platforms, and deadly anomalies like spinning saws.

The only way to stabilize the environment and open the portal to the next sector is to collect **data coins**. These golden tokens contain the code fragments needed to repair the level's exit.

Max's goal is simple but dangerous:

1. Navigate the treacherous terrain.

2. Collect all the Data Coins scattered across the level.

3. Reach the exit before running out of lives.

If he fails, the simulation resets, and he must try again. Can Max conquer the glitches and escape the system?
