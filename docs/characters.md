# Character descriptions

## Max

Max is a prototype avatar designed for stability testing within the simulation. Agile and resilient, he is capable of withstanding the simulation's instability and navigating dangerous glitches. His primary directive is to stabilize the system by collecting **data coins**, driven by a programmed instinct to repair his world.

### Kate

Kate is a former system administrator avatar who got fragmented during the initial crash that created "The Glitch". Unlike other corrupted entities, she retained her core logic and personality.

She appears in safe zones, offering Max guidance. She cannot move between sectors herself, so she relies on Max to collect the **data coins** to repair the system, hoping that one day she can be fully restored.
