# Level

In this first level, the student and the AI work together to overcome a series of platforming challenges in order to reach a critical control area within the simulation. Although the student does not fully escape the virtual world yet, they manage to temporarily disrupt part of the system and obtain crucial information about the experiment and the location of the "bugs". By the end of the level, the professor begins to suspect the AI's betrayal, and the alliance between the student and the AI becomes the foundation for a larger conflict that will continue in future levels.
