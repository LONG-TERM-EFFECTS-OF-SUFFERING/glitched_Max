# Story

A few months ago, the university welcomed a new professor, Elias Strauss, famous for his research in virtual reality. Among the students is Max, a curious young man who dreams of joining Elias's research group, so he submits his application. One day, Elias approaches Max, tells him he has read his application, and invites him to explore his lab. There, he shows him the machines that host the bodies of the people who enter the virtual reality he is developing, which has just received an update that includes an integrated AI assistant. According to Elias, this reality is more than just a game: it can virtualize human consciousness and fully immerse a person in a world where perfection is within reach.

Encouraged by this promise, Elias and Max enter the virtual reality together, where Elias introduces LIA, a new and advanced female AI designed to guide the experience. She leads the tutorial and explains the basic platforming mechanics. Suddenly, Elias's avatar vanishes with a glitch-like effect, and strange signals begin to appear along the path in the form of distorted messages: "do not trust him", "run", "this is not a glitch". LIA reassures Max, saying it is probably just a network error.

After an in-game accident in which a platform is erased by the same glitch, Max falls into an unknown area, a sort of limbo where he meets Alex Serrano and Zoe Martinez, two students who have been missing in the real world for a month but have spent a year trapped inside the virtual world. They reveal to Max the dark purpose of Elias: to create a perfect reality where humans can live more than ten times longer than normal, at the cost of losing all physical function outside the digital environment. Elias has them "locked", restricting their access to the virtual world and limiting them to communicating only through glitches.

Shocked by these revelations, LIA sides with Max, Alex, and Zoe to stop Elias's plans. At that moment, Elias returns and tries to lock Max the same way he did with Zoe and Alex. However, LIA activates a protection system that keeps her new friends safe from Elias's attacks. She cannot directly modify the world, but thanks to Alex and Zoe's knowledge, the group is guided through different environments within the virtual reality. Each one functions as a level with its own challenges and settings, ranging from deep space to lava fields and frozen landscapes. In every level, the goal is to extract information needed to free the system, but Elias reappears as the final boss at the end of each stage, growing stronger every time. Max still manages to weaken him and temporarily block his session, while also uncovering extra secrets. Among those secrets is a photo of Elias with what appears to be his wife and a child, as well as reports on the other trapped students.

In the climax, Max and his allies are about to free the system using the data they have gathered and LIA as the distribution channel for their "patch". Elias wakes once more, corrupts LIA, and locks Zoe and Alex, though they manage to remind Max that LIA is the key in this final moment. Turned into a ghostly threat, LIA only regains her true consciousness when Max shows her the family photo. Then the truth is revealed: LIA is the virtual consciousness of Liana Strauss, Elias's wife, whose body was left in a state of brain death after an accident, leading Elias to transfer her mind into the AI. Before sacrificing herself to destroy the system and free the captives, she confesses to Max that he carries the name of her own son.

Max, Alex, and Zoe wake up in the real world, while Elias, now in a coma, is taken by the authorities after Max calls for help to locate his friends' real bodies. The game ends with a warm scene of Max and his friends sitting in front of the lab at dawn. In a final cut, the camera shifts to show Elias and Liana dancing together in an elegant hall, finally reunited-though only inside the virtual reality.
